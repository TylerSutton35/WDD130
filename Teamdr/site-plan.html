      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Try and think about the last time you played a video game online. Were you also cursed with a bad teammate? Well, same here... You no longer need to worry about having that awful experience again. Teamdr is a website that allows you to search for teammates that meet YOUR standards. You get to decide what you’re looking for in a teammate and our website does the rest. Never play with a bad teammate again.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My intended audience are people who play video games online that typically require you to play with other players (i.e. games with online matchmaking). There are no restrictions on who can use this website so it is intended for any gamers wanting to find teammates based on the parameters they choose to search for a teammate by. The intended audience will also be for any gaming system out there. They will be able to chose which gaming platform they are on so that the players can find teammates on their same platform/gaming system.</p>  <!-- change this -->

        What exactly is Teamdr/what is its purpose? Teamdr is a website that was designed to help gamers from all platforms find teammates or squads that better suit their needs/wants. Think about the last time you played a video game that has matchmaking. Did you get placed with some random person that had no idea how to play the game? Did you get placed with someone who just complains the entire time instead of giving you great call-outs? Or maybe your teammate didnt have a mic at all. No matter the miserable situation, we understand. This is why we built this website, so we can help find teammates that match YOUR preferences.

      <h3>How Teamdr Works</h3>
      <p>
        Are you wondering how Teamdr works? Allow me to explain. Teamdr uses a type of matchmaking similar to what most games already have. The biggest difference is Teamdr match makes based on parameters that you have already chosen. When you first creat an account with Teamdr, you are asked to create either a general profile (which can be used universally for any game you might want to find teammates for) or game specific profile (which has settings/parameters based on the game of choice). Once you’ve selected your profile type, you are presented with a list of options on what you are looking for in a teammate/squad. Some of the options include age, role, mic or no mic, etc. Now that you have chosen the parameters to search by, our website will start the matchmaking process. The website searches for other players that have similar parameters to what you chose for this profile. Once found you receive a notification asking if you would like to squad up with this person and the rest is history. Happy victories to you and your team!

      <h3>Reviews</h3>
      <p>
        Review 1: This website is amazing! I was able to find a teammate that actually has a microphone and understood how to play his role as a tank. Thanks Teamdr!
      </p>
      <p>
        Review 2: Its a 5 star review from me. I have always had bad luck when it comes to my teammates in game. This website has allowed me to find people that understand me and my play style. Definitely recommend this website to anyone that needs help finding better squad members!
      </p>
      <p>
        Review 3: I would have to rate this website a 2 out of 5 stars. When I created my profile I intended for it to be a profile that I could use for all of the games I play. Unfortunately I could only pick a profile based on specific games. Sadly wouldnt recommend this website to anyone.
      </p>
      <p>
        Review 4: Im on the fence with this website. I understand the idea of what this service is supposed to provide but this seems like a big waste of time when I could just hop into a game and play with a random person that I was matched with. I dont have time to sit and wait for a website to find a teammate for me.
      </p>
      <p>
        Review 5: 1 star for me. I couldnt find any people that matched my search parameters for the game I play. If there were more people on here it would be a 5/5 stars. Until then, just 1 star. Sorry!
      </p>
      <p>
        Review 6: This website is fantastic! I love the asthetics of it and love its functionality. One thing I would love for you to add is the ability to have a premade profile that I can quickly use when im in a hurry. Other than that, this websites rocks! Thanks Teamdr!
