            <p>Teamdr uses a type of matchmaking similar to what most games already have. The biggest difference is Teamdr match makes based on parameters that you have already chosen. When you first creat an account with Teamdr, you are asked to create either a general profile (which can be used universally for any game you might want to find teammates for) or game specific profile (which has settings/parameters based on the game of choice). Once you’ve selected your profile type, you are presented with a list of options on what you are looking for in a teammate/squad. Some of the options include age, role, mic or no mic, etc. Now that you have chosen the parameters to search by, our website will start the matchmaking process. The website searches for other players that have similar parameters to what you chose for this profile. Once found you receive a notification asking if you would like to squad up with this person and the rest is history. Happy victories to you and your team!</p>
