            <h1>What is Teamdr?</h1>
            <p>Teamdr is a website that was designed to help gamers from all platforms find teammates or squads that better suit their needs/wants. Think about the last time you played a video game that has matchmaking. Did you get placed with some random person that had no idea how to play the game? Did you get placed with someone who just complains the entire time instead of giving you great call-outs? Or maybe your teammate didnt have a mic at all. No matter the miserable situation, we understand. This is why we built this website, so we can help find teammates that match YOUR preferences.</p>
